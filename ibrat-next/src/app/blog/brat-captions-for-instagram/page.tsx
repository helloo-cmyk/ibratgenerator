          <h2 className="hp-display-heading mt-16 mb-6 !text-3xl">How to Write Your Own Brat Caption</h2>
          <p className="hp-body-text mb-12 text-[17px] sm:text-[18px]">
            To write original brat captions or charli xcx captions, start with your actual reaction to the photo, cut it down to three words max, and drop any unnecessary explaining. Make sure the text is entirely lowercase so it matches the brat summer captions style. For example, instead of writing "I am feeling so exhausted today and just want to sleep," you cut it down to simply "completely exhausted". This method turns long thoughts into sharp brat quote captions, and can even be used to format your favorite brat lyric captions or brat song captions instantly.
          </p>

          <h2 className="hp-display-heading mt-16 mb-6 !text-3xl">Turn Captions Into Visuals</h2>
          <p className="hp-body-text mb-12 text-[17px] sm:text-[18px]">
            Instead of just writing text under a photo, you can type your caption directly into the <Link href="/brat-text-generator" className="hp-link">brat text generator</Link> to create an image. Export it as a PNG and post it as a standalone image or carousel opener. This is the fastest way to get authentic brat text for instagram without manually editing photos. For full meme layouts, you can also use the <Link href="/brat-maker" className="hp-link">brat maker</Link>.
