          <h2 className="hp-display-heading mt-16 mb-6 !text-3xl">Why the Format Works for Social Media</h2>
          <p className="hp-body-text mb-12 text-[17px] sm:text-[18px]">
            The visual format dominates social media because the extreme high contrast stops users from scrolling past. The minimal design strips away all distractions, forcing the viewer to focus entirely on the text you wrote. Whether your followers use light mode or dark mode, the aggressive neon green and black layout cuts through the surrounding interface. Because the style is instantly recognizable, you don't need any additional context for the post to make sense.
          </p>

          <p className="hp-body-text mb-16 text-[17px] sm:text-[18px]">
            If you want to create your own images right now, open the <Link href="/" className="hp-link">brat generator free</Link> tool. It requires no design skills and outputs your exact phrase in seconds.
